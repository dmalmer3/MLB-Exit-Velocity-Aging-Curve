# MLB-Exit-Velocity-Aging-Curve
I tried to recreate a project I saw done by Peter L'Oiseau of FanGraphs.com by creating an aging curve to show how MLB players average 
exit velocity changes as they age. It was an interesting beginner project that helped me learn quite a bit about manipulating datasets to
gather useful information and create new features.
